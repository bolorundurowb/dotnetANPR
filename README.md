# dotNETANPR


## About
dotnetANPR is an automatic number plate recognition software, which implements algorithmic and mathematical principles from field of artificial intelligence, machine vision and neural networks.

This is a work in progress. I am converting the java code in javaanpr into cross-platform C# (that means no reliance on System.CDrawing.Common) which would make the library usable by .NET developers. I have finished porting all the non-GUI functionality but I am yet to convert the GUI (will do that soon). I am currently moving into testing to see how well the library does with recognizing characters and to pick out bugs.

Contibutions are very welcome.

This project aims to port [this](https://github.com/oskopek/javaanpr) library from Java to .NET. Thanks to [Ondrej Martinsky](https://sourceforge.net/u/martinsky/profile/) for the original `javaanpr` library.
